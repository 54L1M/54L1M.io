# Introducing P4ndaLab: My Kubernetes Homelab Journey on Raspberry Pi

Hey there! Welcome to the first post of my P4ndaLab series. I'm excited to share my journey building a Kubernetes homelab on a Raspberry Pi. This project stems from my belief that the best way to learn is by doing - getting your hands dirty and building something real.

## What is P4ndaLab?

P4ndaLab is my personal homelab project focused on building a fully functional Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi hardware. The goal? To create a learning environment where I can experiment with Kubernetes concepts, understand container orchestration, and eventually host my own applications and services.

I chose to start with a Raspberry Pi because I wanted to begin small and work with hardware I already own. This budget-friendly approach lets me dive in without any initial investment. As I progress through this project and if I enjoy it as much as I anticipate, I plan to upgrade to more suitable homelab hardware. But for now, this simple setup is more than sufficient to learn the core concepts and build a functional Kubernetes environment.

As with all my projects, this one follows my naming convention of P4nda, joining my collection of side projects under my [P4ndaF4ce](https://github.com/P4ndaF4ce) GitHub organization.

## Why a Kubernetes Homelab?

You might be wondering, "Why go through all this trouble when you could just use a cloud provider?" Great question! Here's why:

1. **Hands-on Learning**: Nothing beats the learning experience of building a system from the ground up.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: After the initial hardware investment, I can experiment without worrying about unexpected cloud bills.
3. **Complete Control**: I have full control over every aspect of the infrastructure.
4. **Offline Capability**: My lab works even when my internet doesn't.
5. **Transferable Skills**: What I learn here directly applies to professional Kubernetes deployments.

## Project Roadmap: The Kubernetes Phase

For this blog series, I'll be focusing on Phase 1 of my project: setting up a Kubernetes cluster on a Raspberry Pi. I've already completed some initial steps, but I'll be documenting everything as I go. Here's what's covered in the Kubernetes phase:

### 1. Base Infrastructure Setup

- Operating system installation and configuration
- K3s (lightweight Kubernetes) installation
- Basic networking and SSH setup

### 2. Core Kubernetes Components

- Storage configuration with persistent volumes
- Load balancing with MetalLB
- Ingress controller setup (Traefik or Nginx)
- DNS configuration

### 3. Monitoring and Security

- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Visualization with Grafana
- Network policies and RBAC implementation
- Certificate management

### 4. Advanced Features

- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Backup and restore solutions
- Service mesh implementation

## How This Blog Series Will Work

I believe in a structured approach to learning. Each topic will be covered in two complementary posts:

1. **Theory Post**: Explaining core concepts, architecture, and the "why" behind each component
2. **Hands-on Post**: Step-by-step implementation in my P4ndaLab environment

This way, whether you're interested in the concepts or the practical implementation (or both!), you'll find value in following along.

## My Setup

For transparency, here's what I'm working with:

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Server (64-bit)
- **Network**: Accessible via serverpi.local
- **Storage**: External USB SSD for persistent storage

## What's Coming Next

In the next post, I'll dive into Kubernetes fundamentals - what it is, its architecture, and the key components we'll be working with. Then, we'll move on to our first hands-on post where I'll walk through setting up the operating system and installing K3s on the Raspberry Pi.

I hope you'll join me on this journey as I build, break, learn, and share my experiences with P4ndaLab. Whether you're a Kubernetes novice or just interested in homelab projects, I think you'll find something useful here.

Until next time, happy hacking!
